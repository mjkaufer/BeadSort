# BeadSort

Check out the demo [here](http://www.kaufer.org/BeadSort/)

## What Is It?

BeadSort is a sorting algorithm that, theoretically, would sort integers in O(âˆšn) time (but really big space). However, one cannot capture this efficiency in computer simulations because there's no gravity :(

This project was made to visualize the BeadSort process
